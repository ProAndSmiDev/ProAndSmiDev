### üßë About myself:
My name is Andrey Smirnov. I position myself as a Frontend developer. At the moment, it will not be difficult for me to make the layout of any site. 

At the moment, I dream of not covering all the requirements of the business, but at least being guided by them. To do this, I develop my skills in both backend and frontend development in my free time. My dream is also to become a full-fledged full stack developer with knowledge of relevant technologies.

In my free time from work, I enjoy life - I like to walk or go to the cinema/swimming pool. And I always try to find time to develop my skills from the working mode completely so as not to burn out.

Regarding my experience:
- 2 years of commercial experience at SB-Vector (as a web programmer);
- 2 years of commercial experience in the Muz Cult company (as an HTML Coder)
- 4+ commercial experience as a frontend developer at TK-Project

You can contact me if you need to make up a layout from figma to html, you need layout tips, as well as any help with it. At the moment, my services seem scarce, but I will expand them over time - so stay tuned :)
